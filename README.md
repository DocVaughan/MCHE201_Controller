## MCHE 201 Controller Board
This repository contains the library to interface a pyboard v1.1 with a custom board that drivers for two brushed DC motors, one electric linear actuator, and one stepper motor. The breakout board also contains screw terminals that break out the pyboard pins that are used with the MCHE201 kit.

Currently (Fall semester 2018), this library is under development, with hopes to deploy the new boards and this code in the spring semester.
